                <p>Born in Welland Ontario, Ethan Wright spent his life distant from others. His shyness, anxiety and depression growing as he aged. Moving forward in his life, Ethan left behind the life of a labourer and focused on a career in coding to help support the ones he loved. While still new to the form, Ethan makes up for it with a drive and persurverance that cannot be extinguished.  </p>
